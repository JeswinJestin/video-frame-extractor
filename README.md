This idea struck in my mind when I faced difficulty getting an **accurate frame** for editing, so I decided to build one.  
Here it is as a **minimum viable product (MVP)**.


# ðŸŽ¬ Video Frame Extractor

This project helps extract frames from videos (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) using **yt-dlp**, **scenedetect**, and **ffmpeg**.
It was built as a simple MVP to solve the difficulty of getting accurate frames for editing work.
A useful tool for **digital artists and video editors**.
