Perfect 👍 here’s a **single copy-paste block** you can run in Colab to create both the `README.md` and a clean `.gitignore` for your project:

````python
# =========================
# Create README.md + .gitignore
# =========================

# 🎬 Video Frame Extractor

This idea struck in my mind when I faced difficulty getting an **accurate frame** for editing, so I decided to build one.  
Here it is as a **minimum viable product (MVP)**.  
A special tool for **digital artists and editors** who want precise frame extraction.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📥 Downloads videos from **YouTube / Instagram / TikTok** using `yt-dlp`
- 🎞️ Extracts frames at **scene changes** or at **fixed FPS**
- 🖼️ Removes **blurry frames** (optional, uses OpenCV)
- 📂 Outputs all frames as a **ZIP** file
- 🎥 Supports up to **4K resolution**

---

## 📦 Installation
Clone this repo and install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or open in **Google Colab**:

```bash
File → Open Notebook → GitHub → paste repo link
```

---

## ⚡️ Usage

Run the notebook `extractor.ipynb`:

1. Provide a video link (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram).
2. Choose extraction method:

   * **Scene-based detection** → PySceneDetect
   * **Fixed FPS** (e.g., 0.5 fps for more detail)
3. Frames will be saved in `/frames` folder and zipped for download.

Example CLI usage:

```bash
!python extractor.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx" --fps 0.5
```

## 🎨 Example Output

* Extracted frames in `/frames`
* Scene-based cutting ensures **no missed details**
* Works even on **age-restricted content** with `cookies.txt`

👉 After running this, you’ll have `README.md` and `.gitignore` in your Colab working directory.  
Then just push them to GitHub.  

Do you want me to also give you the exact Colab → GitHub push commands (so you don’t have to download/upload manually)?
