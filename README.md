Got it 🙂 You want a **straightforward, proper README.md** file — no code blocks everywhere, no extra noise, just clean text + proper markdown structure (like a real GitHub project).

Here’s the **final polished README.md** you can copy-paste directly ⬇️

# 🎬 Video Frame Extractor

This project helps extract frames from videos (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) using **yt-dlp**, **scenedetect**, and **ffmpeg**.
It was built as a simple MVP to solve the difficulty of getting accurate frames for editing work.
A useful tool for **digital artists and video editors**.

Would you like me to also **generate the exact requirements.txt** for your repo (with the correct versions of `yt-dlp`, `scenedetect`, `ffmpeg-python` etc.) so it’s fully ready?
